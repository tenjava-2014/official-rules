Rules
==============


This repo contains the rules for the July 2014 ten.java contest. You can use commit/line comments to comment on rule changes or PR additions/changes for consideration.

Repository Rules
=============================================

Maven skeleton
--------------

* We will be providing a Maven-based repository skeleton to all repositories.
  * There is no requirement to use our template but we think it will be helpful for those who are unfamiliar with Maven.   
  * We will be providing tutorials and other resources in due course.
* Current progress on this skeleton is available [here](https://github.com/tenjava/repository-template)
  * If you have an idea for the template, submit a pull request or create an issue ticket!

Before the contest
------------------

* Access will be removed.
* Our Maven skeleton (see above) will be pushed over all repositories.

During the contest
------------------

* Access will be restored to the repositories in time for the contest.
* Developers should push to their repository regularly during the contest time.
  * We want to observe your activity throughout the contest, not just one big commit at the end. 
  * If you're committing and pushing less than twice per hour while working then you're doing it wrong.
* Developers must use the provided repository.
* Developers may not accept pull requests during the contest time.
* Binaries should not be pushed to the repository.
* You may use the wiki functionaliy or make use of markdown files to document your plugin.

After the contest
-----------------
* Access to the repositories will be revoked until judging is complete.
* You're welcome to continue working on the project either in our repository or by making your own.
